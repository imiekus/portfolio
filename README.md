## About me
My name is Iga Miƒôkus and since 2018 I have been gaining experience in the IT field in the role of a software quality specialist or, if you prefer, a software tester. I have been involved in the projects for both multinational corporations and local companies. **What marks me out is my particular love for documentation**, which I believe is the foundation of effective project management and ensures transparency at every stage of the project. **I strive to ensure that my actions not only eliminate errors, but also support the long-term success of the projects I work on**.

When asked about my strengths, I would reply that **I value most my diligence, precision in choosing my words and my ability to ask relevant questions**. I bring the most value to a team when I have the space and conditions to put them into practice. This is why, on my career path in IT, **I am keen to join projects where the importance of carefully maintained documentation and involving testers at every stage of the process is understood**.
